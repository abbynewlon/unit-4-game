# unit-4-game
The area where classes and attributes are added dynamically is in the crystalPics id. With a for loop the an image tag is added. Then the the attributes are added. With the img locations being stored in an array. Ideally the for loop would be inside a function but it was not something I could get to work.

When a user clicks on an img the value(which is stored in the value-this attribute) is added to the score and then compared with the target number to see if the game is over. 

It is somewhat unclear if there are functionallities that could have been exicuted with jQuery and I used just vanilla javascript.
