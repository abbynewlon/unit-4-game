# unit-4-game
The area where classes and attributes are added dynamically is in the crystalPics id. With a for-loop an image tag is added. Then the attributes are added. With the img file locations being stored in an array. Then they are appended to the end of the id. Ideally, the for-loop would be inside a function but it was not something I could get to work.

When a user clicks on an img the value(which is stored in the value-this attribute) is added to the score and then compared with the target number to see if the game is over. 

It is somewhat unclear if there are functionalities that could have been executed with jQuery and I incorrectly just used vanilla javascript.
